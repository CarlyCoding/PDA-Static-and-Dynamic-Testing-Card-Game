This was an exercise in static and dynamic testing, for the PDA qualification. The static testing was a task to read through and identify any errors that were immediatley evident (the errors were not to be corrected, only identified). The dynamic testing involved completing the test file and writing the tests for the functions. Any failing tests were to be corrected. All screenshots of failing tests etc. were attached.
